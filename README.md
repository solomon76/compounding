# Shiny App, Compounding interests

This project demonstrates the use of the reactive function and the conditional function from the shiny app. The use of the these two functions will cut down on the time 

## Use of the App

The App calculates the compunded interests over a span of years (t) and with interest rates(i). The principal amount (n) is also needed as an input. 

## Outputs

The App computes the cumlative effects of interest rates with a final principal amount. A graph that plots the effective interests versus years is also plotted
